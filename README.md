# Chess_Engine
Created an interactive chess engine using python for beginners to learn chess and provide a logical interaction with possible moves 
Given having an unbounded loop, and two players, we would like to simulate the chess game.

Assumptions:
There are only 6 chess pieces (one element for each.)  for each player.
Each piece can move based on the chess rule.

In unbounded loop, any time,
Each player should pick one chessman and one move strategy as follow:
1. Input should show player’s name
2. Player picks his/her chessman choice
3. System prints moving options for the chessman
4. Player picks his/her moving option
5. System confirms that this move is proper move and prints the moving option picked by player
6.  System asks next player.

Termination Controlling Termination as follow:
The unbounded loop can stop by entering “stop”

(1) Define variables for corresponding piece
(2) Define two variables for players, name as player1 and player2
(3) Define the controlling moving process for each piece
